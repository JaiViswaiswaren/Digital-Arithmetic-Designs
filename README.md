# Digital-Arithmetic-Designs

A curated set of arithmetic modules written in SystemVerilog, including multipliers (Booth, array), adders (Kogge-Stone, ripple-carry), and dividers. Designed for RTL-level understanding, simulation, and integration into digital systems or FPGA prototypes.

**Digital Arithmetic Designs** is a SystemVerilog-based repository focused on creating modular and synthesizable arithmetic blocks.
