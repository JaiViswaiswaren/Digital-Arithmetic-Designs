# Digital-Arithmetic-Designs
A curated set of arithmetic modules written in SystemVerilog, including multipliers (Booth, array), adders (Kogge-Stone, ripple-carry), and dividers. Designed for RTL-level understanding, simulation, and integration into digital systems or FPGA prototypes.

Digital Arithmetic Designs is a SystemVerilog-based repository featuring clean and synthesizable implementations of core arithmetic units. The collection includes:

Multipliers: Booth, Array, etc.

Adders: Kogge-Stone, Ripple-Carry

Dividers: Basic restoring/non-restoring approaches

Ideal for digital design learners, computer architecture projects, and FPGA-based system designs.
